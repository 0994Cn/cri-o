## Changelog since v1.22.4

### Changes by Kind

#### Feature
 - CRI-O now logs the stage of container or pod creation under system load. This allows users to find why their creation requests are stalling. ([#6319](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6319), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Bug or Regression
 - Fix a bug where ExecSync requests (exec probes) could use an arbitrary amount of memory and disk. Output from ExecSync requests is now limited to 16MB (the amount that exec output was limited to in the dockershim). Disk limiting requires conmon 2.1.2 to work. See https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j and CVE-2022-1708 for more information. ([#5936](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5936), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where child processes of containers in the host's PID namespace appear to leak after the child exits ([#5986](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5986), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Uncategorized
 - Fix CVE-2022-27652 by dropping and refusing to add any inheritable capabilities ([#5996](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5996), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O would leak a log file if a container failed to be created and the pod hadn't yet been cleaned up. ([#5825](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5825), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where exit files were never cleaned up from `/run/crio/exits` ([#6235](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6235), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a rare deadlock while communicating to systemd (RHBZ 2082344) ([#6061](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6061), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Internal pod and container creation timeouts now account for changes in `runtime-request-timeout` in the Kubelet ([#5854](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5854), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Revert fix for CVE-2022-27652 by re-adding inheritable capabilities. While there is a workaround, we believe this causes regression mid cycle with is contrary to CRI-O's backporting policy. The risk of the CVE is low, and so there is little risk in reverting here. ([#6172](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6172), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Use default umask `0o022` if CRI-O runs under a different umask value. ([#6052](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6052), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
