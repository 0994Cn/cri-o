## Changes by Kind

### Other (Bug, Cleanup or Flake)

- Fix a bug where a sudden reboot causes incomplete image writes. This could cause image storage to be corrupted, resulting in an error `layer not known`. ([#3972](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3972), [@giuseppe](https://github.com/giuseppe))
- Fixed bug where pod names would sometimes leak on creation, causing the kubelet to fail to recreate ([#3950](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3950), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- If conmon is v2.0.19 or greater, ExecSync requests will not double fork, causing systemd to have fewer conmons re-parented to it ([#3912](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3912), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))



## Other Changes

- Fixed a bug where exec sync requests (manually or automatically triggered via readiness/liveness probes) overwrite
    the runtime `info.runtimeSpec.process.args` of the container status (for example via `crictl inspect`). ([#3992](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3992), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Fixed crio restart behavior to make sure that Pod creation timestamps are restored and the order in the list of pods stays stable across restarts ([#4010](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4010), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
