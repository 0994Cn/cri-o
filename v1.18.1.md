## Changes by Kind

### Feature

- Add --version-file-persist, a place to put the version file in persistent storage. Now, crio wipe wipes containers if --version-file is not present (presumably it is on temporary storage), and wipes images if both --version-file and --version-file-persist are out of date (presumably there has been an upgrade of cri-o's minor version ([#3647](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3647), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Containers running `init` or `systemd` are now given a new selinux label `container_init_t`, giving it selinux privileges more appropriate for the workload ([#3765](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3765), [@umohnani8](https://github.com/umohnani8))

### Other (Bug, Cleanup or Flake)

- Fix linkmode retrieval on `crio version` for static binaries ([#3734](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3734), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Crio --version output compatibility with previous versions restored ([#3871](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3871), [@afbjorklund](https://github.com/afbjorklund))
- Fix a bug where CRI-O could not start a container if CONFIG_CGROUP_HUGETLB was not set in the kernel ([#3721](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3721), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Fixed bug where Pod creation would fail if Uid was not specified in Metadata of sandbox config passed in a run pod sandbox request ([#3829](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3829), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Make StringSliceTrySplit return a copy of the underlying slice as otherwise the underlying flags in the ctx might be overriden, which can cause issue when the config is reloaded (GetConfigFromContext() is called more than once). ([#3880](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3880), [@rhafer](https://github.com/rhafer))



## Other Changes

- Re-add the behavior that string slices can be passed to the CLI comma separated, for example `--default-capabilities CHOWN,KILL` ([#3692](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3692), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Removed `crio-wipe.service` and `crio-shutdown.service` systemd units from the static bundle since they are not required ([#3699](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3699), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Added info logs for image pulls and image status ([#3851](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3851), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Cleanup default info logging ([#3852](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3852), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Fix some `crio version` oddities ([#3688](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3688), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Return pod image, pid and spec in sandbox_status CRI verbose mode ([#3820](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3820), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
