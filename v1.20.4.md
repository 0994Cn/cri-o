## Changelog since v1.20.3

### Changes by Kind

#### Feature
 - CNI plugins are now passed a K8S_POD_UID environment variable containing the pod UID this sandbox was started for. ([#5029](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5029), [@dcbw](https://github.com/dcbw))

#### Bug or Regression
 - Add the config field `internal_wipe` which moves the responsibility of wiping containers after a reboot and images after an upgrade from the external binary `crio wipe` to the main crio server. This has a handful of advantages, the main one being crio is now better able to cleanup CNI resources after a reboot. ([#5014](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5014), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - ExecSync requests now don't use conmon, instead calling the runtime directly, which reduces overhead. ([#4954](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4954), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O prematurely stopped pulling from a blocked registry, even if there was a mirror for that registry it was allowed to pull from. ([#5034](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5034), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where a container exec process received a little less time than the timeout provided ([#5094](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5094), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where container storage can get corrupted if the `link` directory is missing. ([#5130](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5130), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a performance regression with exec probes ([#5164](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5164), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fixed runtime panic if container storage layers lockfile parent directory got removed. ([#5072](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5072), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
 - Improve memory usage during container image layer extraction. ([#5201](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5201), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
 - Reuse connection when connecting to dbus, as well as reattempt the connection if it fails temporarily ([#5058](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5058), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Uncategorized
 - Fix a bug where an exec sync timeout would fail to cleanup the runtime exec process ([#5000](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5000), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix an issue where a container started with a terminal fails on exec sync calls ([#5122](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5122), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
