## Changes by Kind

### Other (Bug, Cleanup or Flake)

- Fixed regression where it was not able to run exec any more when compiling CRI-O with newer go versions ([#4192](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4192), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- CRI-O now sets `inactive-or-failed` on scopes if using the systemd cgroup manager and if systemd version is >= 236 ([#4453](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4453), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Fix a bug where a sudden reboot causes incomplete image writes. This could cause image storage to be corrupted, resulting in an error `layer not known`. ([#3972](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3972), [@giuseppe](https://github.com/giuseppe))
- Fixed a bug where a container creation failure caused that container to leak in the runtime ([#4237](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4237), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Fixed a bug where crictl only showed pod level stats, not container level stats. ([#4043](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4043), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))



## Other Changes

- Fixed a bug where exec sync requests (manually or automatically triggered via readiness/liveness probes) overwrite
    the runtime `info.runtimeSpec.process.args` of the container status (for example via `crictl inspect`). ([#3992](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3992), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Fix bug where empty config fields having to do with storage cause `/info` requests to return incorrect information (which causes cadvisor to fail to read imageFs information) ([#4176](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4176), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Fixed crio restart behavior to make sure that Pod creation timestamps are restored and the order in the list of pods stays stable across restarts ([#4010](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4010), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
