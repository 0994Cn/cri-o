## Changelog since v1.22.1

### Changes by Kind

#### Feature
 - Add functionality to use taskset to spawn new commands cri-o runs. Now, if InfraCtrCPUSet is called, all newly spawned commands will be placed in the InfraCtrCPUSet (as it's expected to be set to the reserved CPU set that system commands should run on). ([#5547](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5547), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Bug or Regression
 - Fix a segfault if a workload is configured without the resources table ([#5486](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5486), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix bug where `ip a` reports `Error: Peer netns reference is invalid` ([#5558](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5558), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Uncategorized
 - Allow CRI-O to parse > SIGRTMIN signals ([#5439](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5439), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O would never shutdown if the networking plugin wasn't configured correctly ([#5507](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5507), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where a pod given a host IPC or network namespace could configure sysctls on the host ([#5616](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5616), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
