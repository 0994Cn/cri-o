## Changelog since v1.20.6

### Changes by Kind

#### Feature
 - Add functionality to use taskset to spawn new commands cri-o runs. Now, if InfraCtrCPUSet is called, all newly spawned commands will be placed in the InfraCtrCPUSet (as it's expected to be set to the reserved CPU set that system commands should run on). ([#5597](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5597), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
