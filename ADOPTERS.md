# CRI-O Adopters

Below is a non-exhaustive list of CRI-O adopters in production environments:

* [Red Hat's Openshift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/) uses CRI-O as the only supported CRI implementation starting with the release of OpenShift 4. CRI-O was chosen because it provides a lean, stable, simple and complete container runtime that moves in lock-step with Kubernetes, while also simplifying the support and configuration of clusters.

* [Oracle Linux Cloud Native Environment](https://www.oracle.com/it-infrastructure/software.html) has used CRI-O since release due to its tight focus on the Kubernetes CRI and its ability to manage both the [runc](https://opencontainers.org/) and [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) runtime engines.
