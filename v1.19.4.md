## Changelog since v1.19.3

### Changes by Kind

#### Feature
 - Add clean_shutdown_file option to allow crio/crio wipe to verify crio had time to shutdown cleanly ([#5235](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5235), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Add option `seccomp_override_empty` to override an unspecified seccomp profile from being unconfined to being the runtime default. Note: setting this option makes CRI-O not fully CRI compliant, but does increase security. ([#5131](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5131), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Bug or Regression
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O prematurely stopped pulling from a blocked registry, even if there was a mirror for that registry it was allowed to pull from. ([#5120](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5120), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where a container exec process received a little less time than the timeout provided ([#5095](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5095), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where container storage can get corrupted if the `link` directory is missing. ([#5128](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5128), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a performance regression with exec probes ([#5174](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5174), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix an RSS regression with exec sync requests ([#5274](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5274), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
 - Fix potential panic when reopening a container's log ([#5215](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5215), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Uncategorized
 - Fix an issue where a container started with a terminal fails on exec sync calls ([#5123](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5123), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
