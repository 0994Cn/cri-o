## Changelog since v1.24.2

### Changes by Kind

#### Feature
 - Add an option "add_inheritable_capabilities" which adds added capabilities to the inheritable list as well. As of CRI-O 1.24.0, CRI-O drops the inheritable capabilities to fix CVE-2022-27652 . However, this can cause regressions in workloads that attempt to pass capabilities to non-root users through inheritable capabilities. ([#6236](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6236), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Allow `crio.runtime.runtimes` configuration to be updated on reload. ([#6248](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6248), [@elezar](https://github.com/elezar))
 - Allow for a reload to add additional runtimes and change the default runtime ([#6056](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6056), [@elezar](https://github.com/elezar))
 - CRI-O now logs the stage of container or pod creation under system load. This allows users to find why their creation requests are stalling. ([#5683](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5683), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - If `$KUBENSMNT` is defined in the environment, assume the file it points at is
  a bindmount to a mount namespace that CRI-O should join:
  - If the environment variable is not set, take no action.
  - If the environment variable is set and points at a valid mount
    namespace, CRI-O will join that mount namespace.
  - If the environment variable is set but points at a missing file, or the file
    is not a valid mount namespace, CRI-O will print a warning but continue to
    run in the original mount namespace. ([#5974](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5974), [@lack](https://github.com/lack))
 - This adds minimal checkpoint/restore support to cri-o. The minimal support allows to checkpoint a container and restore it again. Optionally it can be restored in another pod. ([#4199](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4199), [@adrianreber](https://github.com/adrianreber))

#### Bug or Regression
 - Added ImageName and SandboxName annotations to the sandbox ([#6164](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6164), [@littlejawa](https://github.com/littlejawa))
 - Fix a bug where `conmon_cgroup` and `monitor_path` became out of sync ([#6255](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6255), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where a container is stuck in INIT because CRI-O believes it to be paused, and never updates the state ([#6122](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6122), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where exit files were never cleaned up from `/run/crio/exits` ([#5508](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5508), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where static pods cannot be created because they've already been created. ([#6123](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6123), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where the GID of the container is not specified in the AdditionalGids, leading to a low risk security vulnerability. For more information please see CVE-2022-2995. ([#6159](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6159), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where updating `default_runtime` would cause the `runc` entry in the runtimes table to be deleted ([#6257](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6257), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix an issue with leaked systemd scopes by always sending runc the `--systemd-cgroup` flag when using systemd cgroups ([#6153](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6153), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fixed possible panic on attach when using `runtime_type = "pod"` if no stdin is being provided. ([#6110](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6110), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

#### Other (Cleanup or Flake)
 - Fix some inconsistencies in the help text ([#6217](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6217), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Update runc to v1.1.4 in static binary bundle. ([#6180](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6180), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

#### Uncategorized
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O would fail if Kubelet specified `-1` for swap (which is a valid way of specifying unlimited) ([#6139](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6139), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
