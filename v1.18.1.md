## Changes by Kind

### Feature

- Add --version-file-persist, a place to put the version file in persistent storage. Now, crio wipe wipes containers if --version-file is not present (presumably it is on temporary storage), and wipes images if both --version-file and --version-file-persist are out of date (presumably there has been an upgrade of cri-o's minor version ([#3647](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3647), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Containers running `init` or `systemd` are now given a new selinux label `container_init_t`, giving it selinux privileges more appropriate for the workload ([#3765](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3765), [@umohnani8](https://github.com/umohnani8))

### Other (Bug, Cleanup or Flake)

- Fix linkmode retrieval on `crio version` for static binaries ([#3734](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3734), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Fix a bug where CRI-O could not start a container if CONFIG_CGROUP_HUGETLB was not set in the kernel ([#3721](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3721), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))



## Other Changes

- Re-add the behavior that string slices can be passed to the CLI comma separated, for example `--default-capabilities CHOWN,KILL` ([#3692](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3692), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Removed `crio-wipe.service` and `crio-shutdown.service` systemd units from the static bundle since they are not required ([#3699](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3699), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
- Fix some `crio version` oddities ([#3688](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3688), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
