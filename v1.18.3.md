## Changes by Kind

### Other (Bug, Cleanup or Flake)

- Fixed bug where pod names would sometimes leak on creation, causing the kubelet to fail to recreate ([#3950](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3950), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- If conmon is v2.0.19 or greater, ExecSync requests will not double fork, causing systemd to have fewer conmons re-parented to it ([#3912](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3912), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
