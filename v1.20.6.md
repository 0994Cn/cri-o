## Changelog since v1.20.5

### Changes by Kind

#### Feature
 - Add functionality to use taskset to spawn new commands cri-o runs. Now, if InfraCtrCPUSet is called, all newly spawned commands will be placed in the InfraCtrCPUSet (as it's expected to be set to the reserved CPU set that system commands should run on). ([#5597](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5597), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Skip SELinux volume relabeling for super privileged containers (`securityContext.seLinuxOptions.type = "spc_t"`). ([#5413](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5413), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

#### Uncategorized
 - Backport the fix of merging storage_option from drop-in files to sttorage_option from storage.conf. ([#5435](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5435), [@QiWang19](https://github.com/QiWang19))
 - Fix a PID leak in situations where conmon fails to be moved into the pod cgroup ([#5370](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5370), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O waits forever on a conmon process that will not stop ([#5408](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5408), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where situations of excessive load on nodes causes containers to never actually start ([#5693](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5693), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix an issue when a container with a terminal has an exec probe ([#5364](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5364), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fixed missing quantile values in `container_runtime_crio_operations_latency_microseconds_total` metrics ([#5265](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5265), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
