## Changelog since v1.22.1

### Changes by Kind

#### Other
 - Introduce the following metrics:
  crio_operations_total, crio_operations_latency_seconds_total, crio_operations_latency_seconds,
  crio_operations_errors_total, crio_image_pulls_bytes_total,
  crio_image_pulls_skipped_bytes_total,
  crio_image_pulls_success_total, crio_image_pulls_failure_total,
  crio_image_layer_reuse_total, crio_containers_oom_count_total
  while marking metric names that do not follow prometheus best practices as Deprecated in Prometheus metric help text. ([#5487](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5487), [@swghosh](https://github.com/swghosh))

#### API Change
 - Drop support for `v1alpha2` Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and require `v1`. ([#5471](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5471), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

#### Feature
 - Add `allowed_devices` field to config, allowing admins to specify which devices are allowed to be specified in the "io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices" allowed_annotation. The default for this config field is [/dev/fuse] ([#5551](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5551), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Add a [crio.stats] table to the config for configuring all things stats-related.
  Add ability (with config field StatsCollectionPeriod) to calculate and save stats for pods and containers, rather than return them on demand.
  Add support for {,List}PodSandboxStats, which allows the kubelet to take advantage of the PodAndContainerStatsFromCRI feature gate--one that is set to be alpha in 1.23. ([#5427](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5427), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Add functionality to use taskset to spawn new commands cri-o runs. Now, if InfraCtrCPUSet is called, all newly spawned commands will be placed in the InfraCtrCPUSet (as it's expected to be set to the reserved CPU set that system commands should run on). ([#5514](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5514), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Add support for TARGET namespace mode, which enables support for ephemeral containers. ([#5440](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5440), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Add support for minimum_mappable_{u,g}id which relaxes the requirement on `sc.RunAs{User,Group}`. If set, the `RunAs{User,Group}` value and any explicitly-mapped host IDs are only required to be at or above the configured values. ([#5462](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5462), [@nalind](https://github.com/nalind))
 - Containers now have a `/run/.containerenv` file to help applications identify that they are running inside a container. ([#5463](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5463), [@pjbgf](https://github.com/pjbgf))
 - Now, if infra_ctr_cpuset is configured, conmon is put in the same cpuset ([#5414](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5414), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Documentation
 - Improved some error messages related to user namespaces. ([#5494](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5494), [@frasertweedale](https://github.com/frasertweedale))

#### Bug or Regression
 - Allow for both runtime class and workload level allowed annotations. Now, if a container or pod has both specified, the list will be merged. ([#5465](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5465), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Conmon now always writes its logs to syslog, instead of only when the cgroup manager is cgroupfs ([#3773](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3773), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O would never shutdown if the networking plugin wasn't configured correctly ([#5284](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5284), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where a pod given a host IPC or network namespace could configure sysctls on the host ([#5610](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5610), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where invalid default_sysctls could be specified, leading to an error like "Failed to configure sysctls after unshare: No such file or directory" ([#5673](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5673), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where memory swap values were specified even if the memory swap cgroup is not enabled ([#5539](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5539), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a bug where situations of excessive load on nodes causes containers to never actually start ([#5590](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5590), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix a potential crash caused by a log message NULL-pointer dereference. ([#5579](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5579), [@klihub](https://github.com/klihub))
 - Fix an issue where protobuf panics when serializing ListContainer and ListPodSandbox calls ([#5606](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5606), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix bug where `ip a` reports `Error: Peer netns reference is invalid` ([#5529](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5529), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fix crypto-profile bind within RHEL based containers. ([#5555](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5555), [@rphillips](https://github.com/rphillips))
 - Fix vm containers couldn't restore after cri-o restart ([#5574](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5574), [@gozssky](https://github.com/gozssky))
 - Fix zsh completion generation. ([#5586](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5586), [@klihub](https://github.com/klihub))
 - Fixed possible runtime panic on pod sandbox stats retrieval. ([#5588](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5588), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
 - Forbid AppArmor profiles with the name `localhost/`. ([#5655](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5655), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
 - Move namespace cleanup from sandbox stop to sandbox remove. This allows veth entries in the network namespaces of pods to be cleaned up earlier ([#5336](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5336), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Uncategorized
 - Changes default config output to comment default values instead of omitting them ([#5007](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5007), [@wgahnagl](https://github.com/wgahnagl))
 - Fix a case where conmon children are sometimes leaked ([#5500](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5500), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Inherits storage configs from storage.conf if crio config does not set. ([#5520](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5520), [@QiWang19](https://github.com/QiWang19))
 - Specify runtime table format in  the error message ([#5452](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5452), [@QiWang19](https://github.com/QiWang19))
 - Update go to 1.17 in go.mod ([#5577](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5577), [@QiWang19](https://github.com/QiWang19))
