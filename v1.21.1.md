## Changelog since v1.21.0

### Changes by Kind

#### Dependency-Change
 - Fix possible segfault when image is deleted by podman while CRI-O is listing images ([#4932](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4932), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Feature
 - CNI plugins are now passed a K8S_POD_UID environment variable containing the pod UID this sandbox was started for. ([#5028](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5028), [@dcbw](https://github.com/dcbw))

#### Failing Test
 - Updated static binary bundle crun version to v0.20 ([#4961](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4961), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

#### Bug or Regression
 - Allow users to customize conmon's resources if a pod is in a workload. ([#4980](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4980), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - Fixed "layer not known" issue during image pull for corrupted `layers.json` files. ([#5015](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5015), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
 - Reuse connection when connecting to dbus, as well as reattempt the connection if it fails temporarily ([#4986](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4986), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Uncategorized
 - Add support for `absent_mount_sources_to_reject`, which allows admins to configure paths that, when mounted into a container despite not existing on the host, causes a container creation request to fail. This is useful for paths like `/etc/hostname`, which causes trouble as a directory, but possibly shouldn't be created as a file either (in the case of a dynamic hostname). ([#4857](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4857), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Add systemd After=crio.service to containers and conmon ([#4816](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4816), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Add the config field `internal_wipe` which moves the responsibility of wiping containers after a reboot and images after an upgrade from the external binary `crio wipe` to the main crio server. This has a handful of advantages, the main one being crio is now better able to cleanup CNI resources after a reboot. ([#4884](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4884), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - ExecSync requests now don't use conmon, instead calling the runtime directly, which reduces overhead. ([#4962](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4962), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug in `internal_wipe` that would mean CNI resources would be leaked across reboots. ([#4928](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4928), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O can't work with runc 1.0.0-rc93 because of an incorrectly specified list of capabilities ([#4831](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4831), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where CRI-O would leak opened files for namespaces on a server restore ([#4795](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4795), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where `crio config` would print a string for `privileged_without_host_devices`, not a boolean ([#4829](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4829), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where an exec sync timeout would fail to cleanup the runtime exec process ([#5002](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5002), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where server startup was significantly slowed down by attempting to clean up CNI resources after a reboot. ([#4934](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4934), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a segfault when CRI-O has takes more than 8 minutes to create a pod or container ([#4846](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4846), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix drop ALL and add back few caps behavior to not include the default configured capabilities ([#4935](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4935), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fixed bug where it was not possible to run containers using the default or no seccomp profile on 
  seccomp disabled builds/machines ([#4819](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4819), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fixed bug where runtime VM created containers never reach their `completed` state. ([#4812](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4812), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Reduce the permission on the listen socket to 0660 ([#4930](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4930), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Update how the resources for a workload is specified. Now, to override a workload, the pod must have the annotation `$prefix/$ctr_name = {"$resource_type": "$resource_value"}`. The workloads feature has also been marked as experimental, which should have happened from the beginning. ([#4811](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4811), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Wait for CNI plugins to be ready before starting non-host-network pods, to allow pods that may run CNI plugins to start faster ([#5084](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5084), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
