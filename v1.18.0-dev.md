## Changes by Kind

### API Change

- CRI-O now runs containers without NET_RAW and SYS_CHROOT capabilities by default. This can result in permission denied errors when the container tries to do something that would require either of these capabilities. For instance, using `ping` requires NET_RAW, unless the container is given the sysctl `net.ipv4.ip_forward`. Further, if you have a container that runs buildah or configures RPMs, they may fail without SYS_CHROOT. Ultimately, the dropped capabilities are worth it, as the majority of containers don't need them. The fewer capabilities CRI-O gives out by default, the more secure it is by default. ([#3119](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3119), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

### Feature

- Added `--cni-default-network`/`cni_default_network` option to specify the CNI network
    to select. The default value is `crio`, but this option can be explicitly set to `""` to pickup
    the first network found in `--cni-config-dir`/`network_dir`. ([#3452](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3452), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Added `conmon`, `runc` and `cni-plugins` to the static release bundle ([#3345](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3345), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Added `linkmode` (dynamic or static) output to `crio version` subcommand ([#3450](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3450), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Added gRPC method names to log entries to increase trace-ablity ([#3383](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3383), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Provide the possibility to set the default config path via `make DEFAULTS_PATH=<PATH>` ([#3321](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3321), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Take local images into account when pulling images prefixed with `localhost/` ([#3309](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3309), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Added support for drop-in registries.conf configuration files. Please refer to the registries.conf.d documentation (https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.d.5.md) for further details. ([#3428](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3428), [@vrothberg](https://github.com/vrothberg))

### Documentation

- Added man page for crio.conf.d(5) ([#3341](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3341), [@rhafer](https://github.com/rhafer))

### Other (Bug, Cleanup or Flake)

- Fixed CRI-O to fail to start when `runc` is no configured runtime and the `runc` binary is not in `$PATH` ([#3367](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3367), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Provide the latest release bundle via a Google Cloud Storage Bucket at:
    https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/k8s-conform-cri-o/artifacts ([#3331](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3331), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Removed annoying logs coming directly from lower level runtimes like runc ([#3416](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3416), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Removed warning about non-absolute container log paths when creating a container ([#3415](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3415), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- ContainerStatus no longer waits for a container operation (such as start or stop) to finish. ([#3457](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3457), [@kolyshkin](https://github.com/kolyshkin))
- Fix bug resulting in false reports of OOM ([#3423](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3423), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Return grpc code NotFound when we can't find a container or pod ([#3412](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3412), [@mrunalp](https://github.com/mrunalp))
