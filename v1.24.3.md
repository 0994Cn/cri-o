## Changelog since v1.24.2

### Changes by Kind

#### Feature
 - Add an option "add_inheritable_capabilities" which adds added capabilities to the inheritable list as well. As of CRI-O 1.25.1, CRI-O drops the inheritable capabilities to fix CVE-2022-27652 . However, this can cause regressions in workloads that attempt to pass capabilities to non-root users through inheritable capabilities. It defaults to true. ([#6260](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6260), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
 - CRI-O now logs the stage of container or pod creation under system load. This allows users to find why their creation requests are stalling. ([#6263](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6263), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Bug or Regression
 - Fix a bug by re-adding the inheritable capabilities when adding capabilities. While it fixes an atypical unix environment, it causes a regression with non-root users using capabilities. ([#6240](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6240), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))

#### Uncategorized
 - Fix a bug where a container is stuck in INIT because CRI-O believes it to be paused, and never updates the state ([#6129](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6129), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
 - Fix a bug where exit files were never cleaned up from `/run/crio/exits` ([#6149](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6149), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))
